      "Title: 2015 volkswagen golf gti se\n",
      "Content: sometimes the best kept secrets demand public attention and the golf gti is a perfect example developed in the early 70s under strict hushhush conditions by some of volkswagens most innovative engineers the gti was let loose in 1976 immediately gaining icon status the model was test engineer alfons lowenbergs vision of a beefed up but lightweight hatchback borrowing design elements from scirocco chassis the inaugural mk1 gti sold 5000 units in less than 12 months fitted with a 16l naturally aspirated 4cylinder engine and fuel injection unit the original gti was the quickest vw produced at the time the second generation was rolled out in 1984 and came with a 18l engine by 1991 the third generation gti engine capacity was elevated to 2liters and the curb weight was significantly heftier since then a diesel model was released turbocharged engines were enlisted and tech upgrades became market leading and the latest incarnation of the seventh generation is a testament to the reputation of the legendary gti exterior the 2015 volkswagen golf gti se that arrived at our doorstep was splashed with classic tornado red paint the superficial alterations made to the seventh generation arent obvious but theyre effective in raising the hatchbacks sporty profile over 2inches longer half an inch wider and 11inches closer to the pavement the engineering team havent tried too hard but what they have done is subtly enhance aerodynamics coefficient of drag sits at 031 the lower center of gravity draws the eye to understated side skirts and 18inch alloy wheels with bridgestone summer performance tires less understated were the fake air vents roof spoiler and power panoramic sunroof which give the car a sporty profile the cpillar and roofline remain quintessentially gti but the front end receives a facelift in the form of new headlight clusters including led fog lights and automatic headlights and a slender meshpatterned grille which welcomes character lines stretching the length of the car and ending at the taillights a number of these lines can be spotted on the cars exterior the horizontal strip above the grille is one example and they lend the car a seamless and sophisticated look interior the new gtis roomier cabin is lush the design team have outdone themselves with a plethora of quality materials to create a tactile haven our testers 935 cubic foot interior was fitted with titan black leather accents and lashings of red stitching the crimson needlework is in good company with awesome red ambient lighting and illuminated doorsill scuff plates setting the mood for a redhot ride additionally some of the buttons and knobs are illuminated in white and as if that werent enough i was surprised when my brother turned on the led reading lights not only because im in awe of anybody who can read at high speed but because this is a feature i havent seen in many other cars the trunk is also bigger 15 larger than the outgoing model and features a clever moving floor that can be raised to create more space i was helping a friend move last week and the rear 6040 seats that fold down flat were indispensable when hauling furniture the cockpit is userfriendly to the extreme with engineers altering the position of numerous controls and optimizing pedal placement even the center stack tilts towards the driver and the adjustable side mirrors with side turn indicators were sensitive without being too delicate the gti instrument cluster adds to the sporty undertones and compliments the 58inch infotainment touch screen perfectly leather adorns much of the cockpit from the flatbottomed multifunction sport steering wheel with gti logo and cruise control switches to the shift knob and brake lever but the loveliest leather components are the heated sport front seats with manual lumbar support volkswagen doesnt skimp on safety features side curtain protection head impact airbags in the front and back are joined by side impact protection door beams for complete protection during all driving scenarios fuel economy theres a lot to like about this car but when you see the epa numbers youll be frothing at the mouth i was certainly impressed when i recorded an average of 26 mpg after a week of driving that number is just 2 below the epas 28 mpg combined average 25 mpg in the city and 34 mpg on the highway are expected performance predictably reliable powering the sporty new gti is a 20l tsi turbocharged inline 4cylinder engine with direct injection the engine is good for 210 horsepower at 4500 rpm if fitted with the performance package the car gets to 220 horsepower which is 10 hp more than the sixth generation torque has massively increased too and the car is now capable of 258 lbft of torque 51 lbft more than the mk6 the 6speed manual transmission generally performed well but gearshifts tended to lag driving mode selection welcomes normal sport individual and comfort modes my brother loved the comfort mode and its adaptive damping system works admirably my favorites on the other hand were the sport and individual modes the ability to alter the steering and throttle while activating individual settings makes it the ultimate winner limited slip differential is right on the money and even the trickiest corners didnt pose an obstacle the cars lower stance and electromechanical power steering meant we always felt safely planted on the ground despite hitting the pedal hard acceleration was consistent and zippy and the car tackles high speeds with more confidence than the outgoing model what hasnt changed is the precise and smooth ride of the gti and its pristine presence on the highway where wind noise and interference are almost nonexistent indeed the exhaust could be described as restrained  even in sport mode driving through the city at rush hour didnt leave me wanting to throttle fellow drivers so thats a bonus instead the gti changed lanes without a hitch and cruised uninterrupted over bumpy sections of road its solid presence and calm cabin made it a pleasure to drive tech overall the tech inclusions are great but the 58inch media device interface mdi connection  which ditches the usb port why volkswagen why  was often irritating we expected to be swiping like tinder pros and pinchzooming in on maps like a microscope but unfortunately the mechanics dont live up to the hype the proximity sensor is a little snaphappy and was activated accidently countless times by myself and whoever was riding shotgun ipod and iphone connectivity are still here but to play a cd or access files on an sd card you have to insert them into slots in the glovebox not only is this kind of dangerous to attempt while in motion itll also be annoying for anyone with short arms and no front passenger in that case stick to listening to the radio amfm and siriusxm satellite radio or mobile apps looking past this slight inconvenience the fender 400watt premium audio system does a fine job at sending airwaves through the cabin with eight speakers and a subwoofer the cars safety features are more impressive than its entertainment settings first theres the climatic singlezone manual climate control with fires blazing up north last week the fancysounding system kept us cool during our test drive our tester didnt come with the all the added extras available  but it did have the important essentials such as driver and front passenger airbags front and side and 3point safety belts for all the seatbelts were more comfortable than most and the latch system was so easy to use i got the nieces and nephews in and out without a problem while side impact protection door beams gave the cabin extra padding against collisions together with the electronic brake force distribution and differential lock i wouldnt have been able to hit an ant let alone a car other noteworthy inclusions are the antilock braking system abs antilock disc brakes and automatic hillhold which would be a lifesaver for san franciscans or anyone in a geographically steep locale meanwhile the stability and traction control is useful no matter the terrain the electronic stability control was smooth and a xds cross differential system made handling pretty damn sharp conclusion without any added extras the 2015 volkswagen golf gti se can be snatched up for a modest 27395 and with extras our model came in at 28 215 love it on a purely aesthetic level the awesome wheels fake air vents black sunroof and sleek lines are irresistible fused with the plush interior  from its unique steering wheel with gti logo and premium leather seats to the red stitching found throughout the cabin  the car is definitely value for money in terms of performance the handling through corners is unreal and the sport mode produced more grunt than expected leave it the problematic mdi connection can be annoying as can the slight turbo lag and sure the gti might cost more than the competition but when you look at some of the opponents its clear the gti trumps the lot as a costeffective premium package in not hard to see why those in the know tout the ford focus st as the gtis closest rival slightly cheaper and slightly more powerful the volkswagen is still our pick of the pair thanks to its luxurious interiors and stylish interior the trims are relatively cheap compared to other manufacturers so even if you decide to get all the bells and whistles the gti still isnt too hard on the budget plus the focus doesnt come close to matching the performance and handing of the volkswagen ford arent giving up without a fight though and the fiesta st is around 3000 cheaper but again fails to deliver the refined performance of the gti likewise the ostentatious subaru wrx is a good alternative but lacks the maturity and prestige of the gti for the price and power the volkswagen is a smart and exhilarating choice photo credit copyright 2015

      "Content: now that september is in full force we can take a moment to reminisce on august which is yet another month when volkswagen tried to make the golf seem more successful than it really is yes ladies and gentlemen thats right im accusing volkswagens public relations department of spinning the truth to make us believe the golf is more popular than it really is actually spinning is the wrong word spinning is what happens when you take some numbers and present them in a way that makes them fit your point of view in this case volkswagen isnt spinning theyre one step away from creating a press release announcing that they did not have sexual relations with that woman but before i get into the wonderful details of this sordid tale a little background information in may 2015 volkswagen changed the name of its popular jetta sportwagen to the golf sportwagen for the us market this is important so im going to repeat it even though this is the printed word and you can read it as many times as you like in may 2015 volkswagen changed the name of its popular jetta sportwagen to the golf sportwagen advertisement its a new car redesigned to use volkswagens mqb platform just like the golf hatchback and unlike the jetta but in terms of dimensions design and market position it is for all practical purposes merely a jetta sportwagen with a new look and a new name so the stage is set you have the new golf sportwagen which is really just a revised jetta sportwagen with a new name and you have the new golf which looks exactly like the old golf to everyone except the guy who designed it so anyway at the beginning of june volkswagen of america released its may sales figures like everyone does and with these sales figures they made a big announcement the golf delivered 6308 units or a 252 percent increase over last year twohundred and fiftytwo percent in fact it was the golfs best may in 15 years at volkswagens us headquarters in virginia trumpets blared marching bands played confetti fell from the ceiling unfortunately no employees saw any of this because they were all stuck in beltway traffic whats more several major news outlets picked up on the resurgence of the golf from business insider to automotive news volkswagen might be coming back was the main point of view and the golf is responsible except there was one little problem golf sales werent really that good they were merely ok how do i reach this conclusion because volkswagen only delivered 1972 units of its traditional golf hatchback in may  admittedly a huge increase over the previous years 685 sales but one thats entirely expected for a fully redesigned vehicle so how did they reach the 6308unit number that made all the papers because a full thirty percent of golf sales were merely sales of a car that used to be a jetta sportwagen in other words this amazing month of 6300 golf deliveries and a 252 percent sales increase wasnt because of some incredible new product that people were fighting over at dealerships a large portion of this figure was due to the fact they had simply renamed a vehicle now when i first saw this i decided i would let it go and i wouldnt write a column about it let volkswagen have their day i said to myself god knows they need it this was reinforced by the fact that volkswagen still had routan sales on the books through the entirety of 2014 even though the things final model year was 2012 but then volkswagen released its june sales figures and its july sales figures and its august sales figures and each time they once again heralded the amazing sales performance of the great new golf savior of the volkswagen brand for proof here are some actual quotes from the press june july and august press releases we continue to see strong results from the golf family delivering the best june in 15 years said mark mcnabb chief operating officer volkswagen of america we are encouraged by the consistent sales growth for the golf across all models within the family said mark mcnabb chief operating officer volkswagen of america we are encouraged by the continued strength of the golf family and confident that success will continue with the model year 2016 vehicles said mark mcnabb chief operating officer volkswagen of america although i am hardly a highly skilled businessman i believe there is one key message to be learned from these quotes the success of the golf has volkswagens chief operating officer encouraged and that leads us right up to last month last month volkswagen proudly announced  in the second bullet point of the news release where they revealed their sales figures  that the golf had earned an 862 percent increase over august 2014 autoblog picked up the story noting that the golf was dramatically outpacing the rest of the compact car segment and i must admit those numbers are pretty impressive that long after a new car has debuted you expect some increase but not 862 percent that new golf must be pretty damn good to be pulling down those sales figures except theres a problem the traditional golf hatchback delivered only 1873 units in august 2015 which works out to merely 100 units more than its august 2014 sales figure  an increase of less than 6 percent so where does that 862 percent increase come from thats right the jetta sportwagen now renamed the golf sportwagen which delivered 2478 units in august in fact the golf sportwagen accounted for more than 35 percent of all golf sales in august 2015 if you take the golf sportwagen out of the equation the golfs year over year increase drops from nearly 3300 units the 862 percent increase to just 798 units  an increase of merely 20 percent not bad but hardly worthy of repeated quotes where volkswagens chief operating officer insists that hes encouraged whats more that huge increase in golf sales that so encouraged volkswagens chief operating officer is precisely mirrored by a corresponding decline in jetta sales thanks to the loss of the newly renamed sportwagen with the sportwagen now a golf jetta sales dropped from 15361 units in august 2014 to 11112 units in august 2015  a decline of 27 percent combine the jetta down 27 percent and the golf up 86 percent and you actually see a yearoveryear decline of 973 sales or around 5 percent that isnt quite so encouraging this proves something many of us have known all along automotive sales are something of a shell game more about presentation and spin than the actual numbers who knows if you redesign a car give it a new name and announce sales are up you might be able to create the illusion of success that isnt there and were not done yet heres the kicker in august the most recent month where volkswagen insisted its sales resurgence was being led by the mighty golf the brands total sales were actually falling volkswagen delivered only 32331 cars in august 2015 compared to 35181 cars in august 2014 for a decrease of more than 8 percent theyre even down yeartodate in spite of all those extra golf sales delivering 238074 vehicles through the first eight months of 2015 versus 244878 vehicles at this point last year fortunately i know of one surefire way volkswagen can turn around that sales decline they can take the audi a4 and rename it the volkswagen passat deluxe this will result in an immediate 200 percent increase in volkswagen passat sales which i have no doubt that the chief operating officer will find encouraging dougdemuro is the author of plays with cars he owned an e63 amg wagon and once tried to evade police at the tail of the dragon using a pontoon boat it didnt work he worked as a manager for porsche cars north america before quitting to become a writer largely because it meant he no longer had to wear pants also he wrote this entire bio himself in the third person\n",

      "to sum up the allegationssince 2009 volkswagen has installed software dubbed a defeat device by regulators in certain cars sold in america that turned on emission controls only when being tested on the road cars were emitting from between 5 to 35 times as much pollutants as allowed by law the number of cars affected about 482000even after regulators smelled foul play over a year ago vw executives claimed that the discrepancies between pollution tests in the lab and higher levels measured on the road were due to a technical error after additional pressure from the environmental protection agency epa they finally admitted this month that the software had been intentionally installed to cheat on the tests as reported by the new york times yesterday\n",

      "so volkswagen decided to focus on diesel technology americans are typically slow to buy diesel cars despite the fact that diesel engines are more efficient and provide better gas mileage this is because traditionally diesel engines dont perform as well as their gasoline counterparts they also have a reputation for being dirty due to the fact that they emit more nitrogen oxides nox and particulates substances that contribute to smog and damages lungs\n",

      "but there is a large law and economics literature on determining the fines to achieve the optimal and efficient amount of deterrence the problem with just passing on the external damages is that vw was not going to be caught with certainty if the executives thought there was a onepercent chance of getting caught it might have been more worthwhile to cheat than if they thought that they were going to get caught with certainty \n",

      "Content: vws problems extend beyond its chief executive winterkorns failures are both a symbol and a product of a system which has proved itself dysfunctional martin winterkorn volkswagens chief executive has been sacrificed in an act of contrition to the shareholders regulators and lawyers circling the german car conglomerate his departure will matter little to the longterm fortunes of vw without an overhaul of the companys governance\n",
      "\n",
      "the emissionsrigging scandal which is being talked about as a corporate failure on the scale of enron or worldcom extends beyond the ceo a company which has admitted to a flagrant violation of global rules and went to such extensive lengths to hoodwink officials has bigger questions to answer than just who takes the blame looking at those with whom winterkorn shared the top table might be one place to start\n",
      "\n",
      "to british eyes the way germany companies are structured looks a bit ungainly at the top vw has a management board made up of executives from across the different business functions and a separate supervisory board which is supposed to appoint and then keep the managers in check half of the supervisory board are voted for by shareholders the rest are from a wider group of stakeholders the makeup is a mixture of shareholders union officials and  in vws case  ministers from the federal state of lower saxony where the firm is headquartered\n",
      "\n",
      "further entangled in the corporate web are the various companies owned by the volkswagen group such as audi seat skoda bentley porsche and so on some of those have their own boards with their own chairman and annual reports members of one board sit on or chair others supposedly providing scrutiny and asking the difficult questions we would expect of a normal director winterkorn who previously headed up audi before the entire vw group was also chairman of audis supervisory board and porsches management board heaven help anybody who has to draw the diagram\n",
      "\n",
      "the goal is to link disparate subsidiaries and management teams into one giant organisation however complex the system has been credited with encouraging familyowned firms and allowing german businesses to take a much more longterm approach than their impatient anglo saxon counterparts there are countless examples where this is precisely what happens and many who believe that the twoboard structure with a big family shareholder is a worthy model the schröder family for instance own nearly half of schröders and two family members sit on the board they have won plaudits for driving a longterm outlook at the company\n",
      "\n",
      "in the case of vw however it appears to have failed volkswagen succumbed to the temptations of patronage privilege and favour by many accounts winterkorn owed his place at the top to a bitter power struggle that embroiled the porsche family and soured boardroom relations he has been there for eight years  a little longer than most ceos at european companies a strong and forceful management team requires daring bold and fearless overseers and a governance system which encourages them to ask the difficult questions for vw to get away with such an audacious con proper oversight must have been lacking\n",
      "\n",
      "the point is that a company needs both the proper structure and the right personnel one cannot make up for a lack of the other somebody at vw messed up  that is beyond question fitting 11 million cars with a piece of software which artificially reduces vehicle emissions during regulators tests is not the work of a few rogue employees that decision was taken and put into action by people of reasonable seniority but the reason it continued unchecked for so long is because the structure of the company stifled honest and transparent oversight\n",
      "\n",
      "if the board members knew what was happening that is clearly severe  and possibly criminal  malpractice if they didnt then that is a dangerous failure of responsibility either way vw need to assess that elusive corporate characteristic  culture  and work out whether their governance rules helped create an environment in which breaking the law was an acceptable course of action in order to sell cars\n",
      "\n",
      "without a robust system that holds management to account there is a risk people will fall into the temptation to cut corners say for instance your new vehicles are not meeting tough emissions requirements you might consider the quick fix if nobody will question what youve done how it works or even notice something has changed we demand more ethical behaviour from our senior executives and flagrant abuses of power are rare but having the right structure in place is fundamental\n",
      "\n",
      "the problems at vw extend beyond winterkorn his failures are both a symbol and a product of a system which has proved itself dysfunctional removing the top brass cannot be the end of the matter good corporate governance places ethical and fearless directors into roles which let them ask penetrating questions hold managers to account advise on strategy and guide the business through good times and bad times have turned bad very quickly at europes largest carmaker and the board cannot imagine that one decapitation will hold back the onrushing tide of lawsuits and fines or repair vws shattered reputation however if the company puts as much effort into fixing corporate governance as they did into fixing emissions tests they could yet stop it being torn apart\n",

      "\n",
      "but of equal importance  more so for its shareholders and 593000 employees  is of what this means for the 78yearold company itself\n",
      "\n",
      "there is a school of thought that would proffer it is too early to tell what will happen and that given the slew of fines and lawsuits that the company potentially faces there might not be a entity recognisable as volkswagen left at the end of it but it is precisely for that reason that the now rudderless volkswagen  following the resignation of chief executive martin winterkorn yesterday  must ensure that it embarks on a path of corporate rehabilitation and do so straight away lest events overtake it and the wolfsburgbased company goes into corporate freefall\n",
      "\n",
      "there are five steps to corporate rehabilitation and volkswagen must follow each step if it is to survive\n",
      "\n",
      "to date it is the only step that volkswagen has even got someway close to completing dont get me wrong it has said sorry that began on sunday with winterkorn and carried on from there by tuesday the now fallen chief executive was endlessly sorry\n",
      "\n",
      "but to apologise is to show regret and that has yet to really happen there is a reason for this  the company does not want to admit any blame lest the gaggle of class action lawyers and assorted attorney generals already circling the company swells to an even greater number but without a proper apology the companys customers will not forgive it not properly\n",
      "\n",
      "the second step is to be honest and admit everything now despite the weight of evidence levelled at the company which has admitted some 11m cars could be affected volkswagen has yet to really provide any detail on how this has occurred the creation of the socalled defeat device  which allowed diesel cars to pass emission tests  could not have been created by a lone wolf someone relatively senior in the organisation had to have known it existed and had to have signed off expenditure related to it the sooner the chain of command with knowledge of the device is disclosed the better given the already intense scrutiny the company faces the details will come out in the longrun and it is better that this comes from the companys lips rather than from those of a prosecutor\n",
      "\n",
      "the third step involves paying fines and working with authorities as much as it physically can using delaying and obfuscatory tactics will not work  and will only anger the companys growing list of opponents yet further the fact that the company has recruited kirkland  ellis the law firm used by bp in relation to the deepwater horizon spill has been seized upon by some to suggest that volkswagen will fight this but although this is a foreign company under attack from the us just as bp was this is a very different situation the deepwater horizon oil spill involved a number of different companies and contractors with no clear sign at first as to who was to blame to date this scandal involves one company  volkswagen there is no one else to blame\n",
      "\n",
      "the fourth step should happen once steps one to three are all but complete clearly this doesnt mean a blanket silence but to pull advertising end sponsorship and for a considered period let the general public forget about volkswagen this should help to end negative connotations with the brand which if salvageable remains one of the companys strongest assets\n",
      "\n",
      "the fifth step is perhaps the hardest of all but can be done in conjunction with the first four is to rebuild the first part of this will be to choose a new leader  which we may know by friday when the board is due to issue its next scheduled update rebuilding will involve changing the psyche of those within the company reminding employees that it remains on the whole a proud and honest company albeit with some bad apples\n",
      "\n",
      "that cultural regeneration will not happen overnight and must be accompanied with strict new regulations on what is and what is not acceptable if volkswagen follows these five steps  some of which will take years to complete  it has a real chance of survival if not the 10day rule will have been proved right once again and the vw marque and all that it once stood for will be destined for the scrap heap\n",

      "Content: review photos 30 videos specificationsyear 2016make volkswagen model passat price  22440 engineinline4 displacement18 l 060 time75 sec est top speed155 mph est posted on 09252015 1800 by jacob joseph   the reasons to be suspicious of the new volkswagen passat start right in the first sentence of the press release where it is stated that the car was designed for the american lifestyle this is troubling because for many years the most compelling reason to buy a passat instead of a honda accord was that it offered a bit of germanness for less than the cost of an audi  a good chunk of that went away in 2012 when vw announced a usspecific version of the car that came in at a much lower price point but at the expense of the things that had made the car special\n",
      "the us passat has effectively been a different model from the one the rest of the world gets ever since then a bit bigger and a bit cheaper with the 2016 model volkswagen has made an effort to make the passat more similar to the european b8 2015 volkswagen passat  which has been sold there for nearly a year at this point this has largely been successful and it will probably sell quite well assuming that volkswagen ever recovers from the dieselgate scandal  because as dull as it was the previous generation of the passat was a huge sales hit\n",
      "continue reading to learn more about the 2016 volkswagen passat\n",
      "continue reading exterior\n",
      "the changes to the 2016 passat constitute a midcycle refresh and not an actual new generation so the changes both inside and out are predominately cosmetic most of these changes come from the european b8 passat and include a bit more chrome and a redesigned front fascia with slimmer headlights and the european grille but the most significant change is that the rline package is being offered for the passat for the first time in the us this comes with big 19inch wheels a new rear diffuser and rocker panels and black accents most notably on the front bumper it doesnt suddenly turn the car into an audi rs4  but it really does improve the appearanceinterior\n",
      "the layout of the interior is the same as that of the outgoing model but vw has made little changes to the details here and there this is best exemplified by the steering wheel which is no longer used as a way for vw to show off just how cheaplooking plastic can be the new cabin gives every appearance of having been made with higher quality materials and this is good since that was one of the major failings of the current generation the car also gets the latest vw infotainment system now compatible with apple carplay and android auto volkswagen also claims that the system now boasts faster response times which is always a good thingdrivetrain\n",
      "the engines from the 2015 model will all carry over for the 2016 at least in theory the 20 tdi is not currently being sold and for the time being there is no word on when it will again be available vw has listed it among the engines being offered but the press release was almost certainly written before vw landed in hot water over diesel emissions assuming that it ever is cleared by the epa and offered again it will probably be worth considering as the north american passat holds for the moment anyway the guinness world record for fuel economy in a nonhybrid say what you will about the emissions those tdi engines still know how to sip fuel the gasoline engines are a 18liter turbo and a 36liter vr6 putting out 170 and 280 horsepower respectivelysafety\n",
      "the outgoing passat has a fivestar safety rating from the nhtsa and there is no reason to think that this would change nonetheless the passat has some new safety features in the form of driver aides there is adaptive cruise control forward collision warning autonomous emergency braking blind spot monitoring lane departure warning and parking steering assist there is also a new postcollision braking system which will apply the brakes following a major crash to help bring the car to a stop in the even that the driving isnt applying the brake for whatever reason all of these features are optional extras a rearview camera however is now standardprices\n",
      "volkswagen will be releasing full pricing info once the 2016 passat is headed to dealerships but the price of the base 18 model was released 22440 thats the same as the current model equipped with an automatic transmission so its safe to assume that the passat pricing will largely stay the same for the same levels of equipment vw did say however that there would be some changes to the trim structure this was done to increase the passats value story a particularly loathsome example of marketingspeak so the prices of trims may change even if the pricing on equipment doesntcompetition2016 honda accord the longtime king of this segment the accord was also designed with the american market in mind but without being so aggressively cheaplooking its generally one of the more entertaining cars to drive in this segment and even when equipped with the cvt it isnt quite as bad as you might expect there are other options but the accord borders on being a secret enthusiasts car hiding in plain sight\n",
      "you can read our full review here 2013 ford fusion considered by many to be the most attractive vehicle in the segment the fusion is the passats biggest challenger in europe where it is sold as the mondeo as with a number of other ford models the fusion has become one of the best ways to get a bit of that european flavor that the passat no longer offers the fusion also offers a couple of different hybrid versions bound to become much more popular now that their biggest diesel competitor has been taken out of the running\n",
      "you can read more about it here conclusion\n",
      "the 2016 passat is a somewhat better version of what is still a fairly dull car theres nothing really glaringly wrong with it but apart from a base price that is very slightly cheaper than its competitors there is nothing about that would really compel you to buy it but a lot of people seem to like ordinariness in a car and some of the most unassuming models have made their homes at the top of the list of bestselling cars the outgoing passat was never as popular as its competitors in the us but it was much more popular than the previous passat this change might make it more popular still but it will need all of the help that it can get given how people currently feel about vw\n",
      "love itrline makes for a passat that is once again decentlookingsolid infotainment system that isnt needlessly complicatedinterior wood trim can pass for the real thing\n",
      "leave itstill not as exciting as passats used to beno diesel for the foreseeable futurestill no wagon version\n",
      "press release\n",
      "volkswagen of america inc is pleased to announce the debut of the new 2016 volkswagen passat a midsize sedan that is designed for the american lifestyle and built in volkswagens stateoftheart factory in chattanooga tenn the 2016 passat features a winning combination of design interior and cargo space classleading technology available driver assistance systems and powerful yet frugal engines in addition a revised trim structure will enhance the passats value story\n",
      "design\n",
      "the 2016 passat features more aggressive styling than its predecessor with a new hood front fenders grille front and rear bumpers trunklid and available led headlights and taillights in short the only sheetmetal that remains unchanged is the roof the doors and the body side stamping\n",
      "we applied a progressive design strategy with the new passat giving the car a dynamic presence and a more sophisticated look said klaus bischoff head of design volkswagen we have integrated several new design elements including a sculpted domed hood that significantly sets the car apart from its predecessor\n",
      "slimmer headlights a more substantial fourbar grille and the muscular domed hood all work together to give the passat a wider more planted stance from the front at the back the new car has a premium europeanstyle flush rear license plate area additionally a new chrome strip on the trunk makes the rear lights appear lower enhancing the grounded appearance while chrome on the window surrounds bumpers and door trim adds to the premium nature of the design available on all trim lines dramatic led headlights and taillights provide better lighting performance with reduced energy consumption\n",
      "for the first time volkswagen is offering an rline version of the passat this sporty model features unique rocker panels a stylized front bumper with contrasting black accents a modified rear diffuser and 19 anthracite salvador aluminumalloy wheels shod with 23540 zr rated tires\n",
      "inside the 2016 passat gets an extensively upgraded interior for a more sophisticated look and feel a new instrument panel features two large gauges and the center stack incorporates vws latest mib ii infotainment system the interior also features upgraded materials a new steering wheel and column stalk design twotone décor panels and refined chrome and piano black trim heatable rear seats are a new available feature along with easyopen keyless access that opens the trunk via moving a foot near the rear of the vehicle\n",
      "technology\n",
      "the 2016 passat features volkswagens secondgeneration modular infotainment platform also known as mib ii the system features touchscreens as standard equipment on all models on most models the display utilizes a capacitive touch sensor similar to smartphone and tablet technology enabling gesture controls like swiping and pinchzooming rather than the resistive touchscreens that require pressure and have slightly longer response times most mib ii units also feature a proximity sensor which detects when a hand is nearby and automatically switches its display to allow easier selection of specific features usb and bluetooth connectivity are standard on all 2016 passat models\n",
      "the mib ii system also serves as the foundation for the available volkswagen carnet system one of the most comprehensive suites of connected vehicle services and features available in the automotive industry today vw carnet includes appconnect technology featuring the three major smartphone integration platformsapple carplay android auto and mirrorlink this allows seamless integration with the vast majority of smartphones available today\n",
      "volkswagen also offers a combination of new safety and driver assistance systems in the 2016 passat the automatic postcollision braking system standard on all 2016 passat models builds on the premise that a collision is rarely a single instantaneous action but rather a series of events that follow the initial impactwhich can cause additional collisions the system helps address this by applying the brakes after a primary collision is detected by the airbag sensors thus helping to reduce residual kinetic energy and in turn reduce the chance of additional damage\n",
      "depending on trim level passat models come equipped with the following advanced driver assistance systems adaptive cruise control acc forward collision warning and autonomous emergency braking front assist blind spot monitor with rear traffic alert lane departure warning lane assist which actively steers the car back into its lane and parking steering assistant park assist all 2016 passat models have rearview cameras as standard equipment\n",
      "powertrains\n",
      "the 2016 passat is available in the united states with three powertrains the 18liter turbocharged and directinjection tsi four cylinder 20liter tdi and the 36liter vr6 engine which makes 280 horsepowerone of the highest outputs in the midsize sedan class the 2016 passat 18t has an epa estimated highway fuel economy rating of 38 mpg with the automatic transmission\n",
      "full pricing for the new 2016 passat will be available closer to launch later this year but the 18t s model starts at 22440 which is the same price as the previous base model when equipped with a sixspeed automatic transmission the passat is produced at the volkswagen chattanooga assembly plant the only automotive manufacturing facility in the world to receive platinum certification by the us green building councils leadership in energy  environmental design leed program\n",
